feat: Implement call center dashboard
Preview

I've created a comprehensive call center operations dashboard that will perfectly suit your needs! Here's what the application includes:

Key Features:

File Upload Interface: Drag-and-drop or click to upload images/text files with your performance data
Brand Performance Comparison: Side-by-side comparison of all your brands with key metrics
Interactive Dashboard: Real-time stats showing quality scores, active agents, calls handled, and handle times
Performance Trends: Charts showing 3-month trends and current vs target performance
Responsive Design: Works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
The dashboard processes your uploaded data (like the performance table you showed) and transforms it into beautiful, actionable visualizations. You can easily compare brands like COLIBRI against others, track KPIs like quality scores, shrinkage, attrition, and CSAT, and identify areas that need attention with color-coded status indicators.

Simply upload your data files and watch as the dashboard transforms your raw numbers into compelling visual insights that will help you manage your call center operations more effectively!

What's next?
Refine & Customize: Tweak the design, animations, and layouts via prompts or visual edits.
Master Prompting: Use "chat mode" to plan out your project without making edits. Use clear, detailed, and iterative prompts for best results.
GitHub Sync: Transfer your project's code to GitHub for two-way sync of edits.
To handle data input from images or text files and create a dashboard, you will likely need backend functionality. Supabase is a simple way to add these features without complex technical setup.
